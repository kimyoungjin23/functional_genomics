This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


find the vignette in tximport
```{r}
library("tximport")
vignette("tximport")
tximport(files, type = "salmon", tx2gene= )
```
you can also consider using tximeta
```{r}
BiocManager::install("tximeta")
library("tximeta")
```

this is because fasta and gtf information should follow around the analysis data. play around with the vignettes.

DESeq2 filters out a lot of outliers if sample size n<6. edgeR or limma are less hard. nonetheless, they all filter pretty well.

paired end reads are good because they help you to assess fragment levels and biases.

drimsesq and dexseq both use annotated transcripts to come up with PSI

dexseq: each tx gets a separate dispersion parameter. drimseq assumes equal dispersion per transcripts belonging to a gene. swimming downstream.

OFDR is what you use for stageR
stageR can be used for any two-stage tests. not necessarily just for DTE and DTU
